Now, we could either go on talking about the basic syntax of function declaration, how the whole story works, etc... OR we could simply take a look at the following image that puts it all in a graphical, and hence, easy-to-understand context (all the credit is due to <a href=\"http://learnict.it/computerscienceposters/\">LearnICT.it</a>):\n",
