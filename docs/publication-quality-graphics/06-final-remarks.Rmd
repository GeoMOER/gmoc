# Final remarks

Okay, so now we have a rather comprehensive, though far from complete (if that is even possible) set of tools for visualizing our data using classical statistical plots.

We hope that this tutorial was, at least in parts, useful for some of you and that we were able to expand your skill set of producing publication quality graphics using R to some extent.

As mentioned at the beginning of this tutorial, we are happy to receive feedback, comments, criticism and bug reports at the e-mail address provided.

Cheers,

Tim and Florian
